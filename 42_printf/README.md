## 💡 About the project

> _This project aims to recreate a simplified version of the `printf` function in C._

This project involves implementing a custom version of the `printf` function, which is commonly used in C programming for formatted output. The focus of this project is to understand and work with **variadic arguments**. The function will support several basic format specifiers like `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, and others, similar to the standard `printf` but without the extensive features.

For more detailed information, check the [**project subject**](https://github.com/Surfi89/42cursus/tree/main/Subject%20PDFs).

## 🛠️ Usage
